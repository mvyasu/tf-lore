The first shot is of Glamora, one of the casinos in the Las Vegas arena.\n\nIt then shows multiple shots of contestants fighting inside the new arena. Afterwards, it shows a clip of a heavy wearing an outfit inspired by Elvis swinging a guitar. The clip then reverses and shows a screen that has red text reading the following:\n\n7 Minutes Earlier\n\n\nThe next shot is of The Announcer getting up from a chair and yelling the following:\n\nAnnouncer: This trio dominated the rooftops of Monaco, and join Diamond League at Skyway Stadium! fades into the background\n\nHe says that while a trio including Odilia, walking down the hallway before a round of THE FINALS.\n\nThe trailer then proceeds to show multiple shots of contestants fighting in various arenas including Monaco, Seoul, Skyway Stadium, and Las Vegas.\nThere are also a few frames showing an OSPUZE can surrounded by tentacles.\n\nAs the trailer continues to show more clips including new Season 1 content, The Announcer says:\n\nAnnouncer: Sensational! No room from The States here at THE FINALS!\n\n\nMore shots of Las Vegas are shown, including a few variants for the arena.\n\nA Nama Tama wearing a dealer visor can be seen throwing multiple playing cards. Amongst the playing cards, there’s a Joker card with a Robatama and a Jack card with a Nama Tama wearing a helmet.\n\nFor a brief second, a message from CNS can be seen seen reading:\n\nGOOD EVENING !\nTHIS BROADCAST HAS\nBEEN HACKED BY CNS\n[ ONE NIGHT, THREE DAWNS,\nSEE THE SIGNS ]\n\n\nA two clips of the new gadget, the Vanish Bomb, are briefly shown. One of them include Odilia using it by smashing it to the ground.\n\nAfterwards, more shots from Las Vegas are shown off.\n\nThe trailer ends with Odilia and a footer that reveals that Volpe and Holtow are the official sponsors for Season 1."},"Seasons/S01/03_MuCoDOS":{"slug":"Seasons/S01/03_MuCoDOS","filePath":"Seasons/S01/03_MuCoDOS.md","title":"MuCoDOS","links":[],"tags":["multico","mucodos"],"content":"Video Link: www.youtube.com/watch\n\nCopyright (C) 1982\nMultiCo\nAll rights reserved.\nVersion 76.3.17\nThursday 08-Dec-23 03:13:38\n\nThe Season 1 credits contained MuCoDOS, an operating system by MultiCo.

The story takes place about 75 years in the future.\nThe Gameshow\nContestants and showrunners all join through VR-tech. \nContestants are largely unknown before they compete; fame comes with being on and winning the game show. Sponsors want exposure to this massive audience for their brand and products/services, and sponsored gear is a sign of a success for contestants.\nTHE FINALS feels sporty, but it leans away from sports and toward entertainment. THE FINALS is not about survival - even though the combat and competition can be brutal, the violence is balanced by the show’s approachable and playful premise and style. This relates to our style &amp; tone pillar of “appeal and brutality.” “Coin death” and VR-effects communicate that this isn’t real; no one is getting hurt.\nWhy have this site?\nTHE FINALS has had a lot of lore revealed throughout the years, but it has been a tiny bit hard following along with how the story has progressed.
