- Scotty, they're flaunting their style!
- Scotty, they're a team of tough customers!
- It seems that they're almost unbreakable, Scotty!
- So far, not a dent in their armor, Scotty. Not even a crack!
- I wouldn't recommend getting in their way, Scotty!
- Generating some serious power there, right, Scotty?
- Strength in numbers, Scotty. Strength in numbers.
- A truly unbelievable scene in the arena Scotty!
- Did you see that coming, Scotty? I sure didn't!
- I am amazed, Scotty. Oustanding, don't you think?
- It was a singular play stemming from exceptional teamwork!
- Now that's something you don't see very often, Scotty!
- It was an unusually good play.
- For once, The Retros might not need to come back!
- They're showing us that the old school moves still work.
- A classic play, Scotty.
- Tipping the scales in their favor with that move!
- They're really playing in concert, Scotty. Beautiful arrangement!
- They found their rhythm with that play.
- There'll be dancing on the tables before long, mark my words, Scotty!
- Now THAT'S how to make an entrance!
- That will be a huge influence on the round.
- That was a real bite-sized master piece of a play!
- I didn't realize they were so good at playing fetch!
- I'll bet there will be tails wagging after that move.
- First-class move for the round's first cash!
- Life in the fast lane, Scotty. What a ride!
- Full throttle ahead, Scotty, what a way to open!
- Scotty, that's what you call cod. Cash On Delivery!
- They're definitely not flopping around out there!
- A real feeding frenzy at the cashout station.
- They're trying to leave the competition in their wake!
- Scotty, they're really drenching the competition!
- They're really springboarding into this match.
- They're flipping the switch to turn on the juice!
- That will cahrge up the round.
- They are truly bounding ahead, Scotty!
- There's no limit to where they can go from here!
- That payday is bound to come in handy for them.
- Scotty, if I were them, I'd be steaming mad!
- Steam has gotta be coming out their ears now!
- They were on the wrong side of that leveling.
- I'd say 'oh, how the mighty have fallen' if it weren't so cliche!
- More plight than might for them!
- And with that, they've gone from will to may to might. That's a grammar joke, Scotty.
- Not the pose that I would be striking if I were them!
- Scotty, they'll need to be more vogue than rogue to stay on trend!
- That's not a trend that I recommend our contestants follow.
- Tough beans for them!
- Scotty, the competition really shelled them!
- They'll need to hide in their sheels for a bit.
- The contestants did a real demolition job on them!
- They'll need to recharge now!
- Scotty, even the best come grinding to a halt.
- That'll be a shock to their system!
- Scotty, they've picked the wrong way to inspire awe!
- I don't think any one say that coming.
- They're as common as a four-leaf clover in the arena now!
- They are as scarce as hens' teeth now, Scotty!
- Too bad, because winning is the true collectors' item here.
- Scotty, they'll want to do a retrospective on that play!
- I guess some plays do go out of fashion!
- They'll be in need of a comeback now.
- That's not the kind of percussion they were hoping for.
- I'm not so sure that's music to their ears!
- Scotty, they've gone from plenty of notes to a three-beat rest.
- That's not how you should RSVP to a party, Scotty!
- This one time they won't want to be the talk of the town!
- Yeah, that stings like being cut out of your friends' inner circle.
- They've been made a cat's paw!
- They're off to the doghouse now!
- Scotty, I bet there'll be some bowed heads and tucked tails on that team.
- They'll be cooling their jets now, Scotty!
- The competition told them to go fly a kite!
- Hopefully they bough a return ticket back from that wipeout.
- I guess the competition didn't have bigger fish to fry after all, Scotty!
- They're definitely a fish out of water!
- Looks like they took the bait and got hooked.
- They could find themselves in troubled waters now!
- They might be in hot water now.
- Safe to say someone hit them with a cannonball, Scotty!
- I think that's what they call low voltage!
- That's what I call an alternating current.
- Scotty, it looks like they got their wires crossed.
- That could have an immeasurable impact on the round!
- It was bound to happen at some point, Scotty!
- That's right, I guess they have limits after all!
- And that's the end of the apocalyptic Meteor Showers. We'll return to regular, old-fashioned arena destruction now!
- And that's a wrap. this Meteor Showers event was proudly brought to you by our generous seasonal sponsors.

- And that's a wrap. This Low Gravity event was proudly brought to you by our seasonal sponsors.
- Low Gravity is over, so our contestants will need to use their virtual muscles, or a jump pad, to get some air again!
- I hope our contestants were not midair, as we just returned to normal gravity!
- And that's the end of the Low Gravity event!
- Mega Damage has finished. I hope that satisfied our fans' calls for amped up action!
- And that's a wrap. This Mega Damage event was proudly brought to you by our generous seasonal sponsors.
- The lack of regulations on damage might have got a bit out of hand there, Scotty. We are now back to normal damage!
- Mega Damage is over, and we are back to a somewhat controlled amount of chaos again!
- And that's the end of the Mega Damage event!
- The Death Match is finished, but for our fans, I'm sure the eliminations will continue!

- This is going to be such a blast. Make the wrong move and you'll see what I mean. If you get eliminated you'll be going out with a BANG!
- Parting is such sweet explosion. At least that's what our contestants who get eliminated in the arena will experience.
- Endings are about to get a bit more explosive, as contestants that are eliminated in the arena will go ka-boom.
- and it's The Dead Go Boom! Volatile Contestants!
- It's colossal chaos time. We've cranked up the damage that contestants will experience in the arena.
- Things about to down-right devastating in the arena, as any damage is about to be magnified, amplified, and intensified.
- Things are about to get very dangerous in the arena, as damage will be cranked up a notch or twelve.
- Watch your step - things are about to get a bit lighter!
- Isaac Newton would not be happy with this. Everything from contestants to grenades are going to move differently.
- Throw away your physics textbooks and hold on to your chairs. Things are about to move a bit differently.
- We're about to get up close and personal with some serious cosmic debris.
- Our contestants will have to look up and look out. We have meteors coming in.
- It's time to see what event will try to knock our contestants off their game.
- Okay, there's a new event coming up in the round for our contestants.
- I wonder whether our contestants brought their rain gear. And a flashlight. It's dark and stormy in the arena.
- A stormy night means poor visibility, but it's a great seting for our contestants to start some mischief.
- Our contestants might want to head indoors. A stormy night in the arena could prove wuite distracting.
- It's a wet one in the arena. The rain is blurring outdoor views, and it isn't making relaxing sounds either.
- Lots of rain in the arena, and with that comes plenty of noise and distraction. It might be wise to head indoors.
- I hope our contestants aren't scared of the dark, as it's nighttime in the arena with reduced visibility.....Boo.
- Nighttime here, with reduced visibility. Hopefully our contestants will bring mightnight madness to the arena.
- Nighttime here, with reduced visiblity. Our contestants are looking for a midnight snack and lots of cash.
- Who knows what's going to be lurking around the corners out there in the dark? Low visibility for this round.
- It's dark out, with reduced visibility, but it's not bedtime for our contestants. At least not yet!
- They're signaling something, Scotty. They're saying game on!
  Now, that's how you play to win this game show!
- Aggressive and impressive!
- Definitely not a defensive strategy!
- I wonder what else they can get away with!
- One skilled play can change the game!
- Remember, that's illegal in many jurisdictions. But not here!
- Will they make this a spree, I wonder?
- But will there be consequences, Scotty?
- Fortune favors the bold, Scotty!
- That was unexpected!
- Can you believe it!
- Wow, that was a bold play!
- They just upped the ante, Scotty!
- Risky moves reap rewards!
- A move that definitely sets the stakes higher, Scotty!
- That could be a game-changer!
- That gamble paid off big time, Scotty!
- Ah, that was so well played!
- Big rewards from a risky move!
- New vaults in play. However, this late in the round it'll be a challenge to make something out of it. Let's see how it pans out!
- New vaults are up for the taking, this opens up new opportunities for our contestants.
