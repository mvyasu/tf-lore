>**Scotty:** Congratulations to The Big Splash, who made big waves with their winning strategy. We'll see you next time at THE FINALS!

>**Scotty:** Alright, we're out! Trying to commentate in that CNS arena is driving me nuts!

>**June:** Yeah, but our ratings are up, and the viewers seem to be responding to CNS.

>**Scotty:** Well, we're playing in their digital playground now and we're clueless about their end goal.

>**June:** Sounds like you don't like the idea of a little change.

>**Scotty:** A little change? They said they're here to change the game. A new arena and a bunch of new equipment? Who knows what's next?

>**June:** Eventually, VAIIYA will isolate the attack and secure the show. They won't let this go on forever.

>**Scotty:** I don't know. If VOLPE's tech let them in, can VAIIYA really kick them out?
