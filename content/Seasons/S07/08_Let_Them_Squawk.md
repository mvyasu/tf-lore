>**Marcel:** Well, well. We left the door open and look who crashed the party.

>**Scotty:** What even was that?
>
>**June:** An attack on the sponsors, frogs everywhere, and some kind of hacked poem.
>
>**Marcel:** Creative, I'll give them that.
>
>**Scotty:** So what? We'll just let CNS call the shots now?
>
>**Marcel:** Easy big boy. They want attention? Let them squawk. The biggest event of the year is just around the corner. The Major will pull every eye where it belongs.
>
>**Scotty:** So we drown out the rebellion with applause. Love it!
