>**Ariad:** This is a message to the world. We're pulling back the curtains. Here's the story they'd hope you forget. Three perfect frogs sitting by a pond, when the world whispered so soft from beyond.

>**OPSUZE SHORTAGE SPARKS REGIONAL UNREST**
>Distribution lapse across Gridline 9 triggered widespread motor disruption and behavioral instability. Local feeds report riots, sleep collapse, and skin detachment symptoms. OPSUZE Systems cites "shipment rerouting".

>**Ariad:** One tasted shimmer in a glittering fly, but the hunger stayed aloud. She never knew why.

>**FORMER DISSUN ZONES DECLASSIFIED AS UNINHABITED**
>Six previously active production sectors have been removed from operational maps. All associated personnel files have been scrubbed.

> **FUEL TECHNICIANS MISSING AT DISSUN FACILITY IN SECTOR 131**
> Five biogenic fuel technicians failed to return following routine filter inspection. This marks the third incident of its kind reported this quarter.

>**Ariad:** One rode the current, fast and revered, but the water was thick with the frogs he once cheered.

> **CONTESTANT MISSING AFTER GLITCH IN THE SYSTEM**
> Speculation on THE FINALS contestant's disappearance has led many to believe the contestant suffered from an 'emotional drift' following a facial chip calibration failure at VAIIYA's headquarters. VAIIYA's representatives issued a 6-day cooldown and assured that the contestant 'will recuperate all' facial mobility and cognitive capabilities soon.

>**Ariad:** Once they'd neared shore, thought it was by choice. She lept on command, her croak without voice. Three perfect frogs by the pond once more. Not leaping. Not croaking. Not like before. But the wild still remembers, and so does the stream. Their croak isn't lost, just caught in a dream. We give you the truth. Fly free. Rise above. No curtains, no constructs. From CNS, with love.
