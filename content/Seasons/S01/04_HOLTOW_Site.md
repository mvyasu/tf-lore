An in-game Holtow QR Code led to HOLTOW's website. The HOLTOW site launched this season with only a blinking red dot gif named `5.15.25`.

### 5.15.25.gif

Eventually, before Season 2, the site changed to a new gif. This time it was named `_-_-_`.

The gif contained various pieces of text. For example:

>READY
>
>"", 8, 1
>
>WE ARE CNS

Later on, the website would be updated to be more proper. However, that didn't happen until [Season 4](10_HOLTOW_Site).
