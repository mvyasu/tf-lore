The video shows the first clip near the campus part of next season's map SYS$HORIZON.

>**June:** Hmm, the messages tend to appear at the big matches. It's certainly not random.

The video then shows another clip from SYS$HORIZON's library.

>**Scotty:** I mean, I guess it could be a publicity stunt.

>**June:** That would explain why VOLPE's tech hasn't blocked them. But, what if it's not a stunt?

>**Scotty:** All I know is that whatever CNS even is, it can't outsmart THE FINALS.
>
>**June:** True enough. And if CNS wanted to earn real fame, they'd need to compete. Just like you Scotty!
