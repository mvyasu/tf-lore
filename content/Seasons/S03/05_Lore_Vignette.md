>**Scotty:** All right, we're clear. June, what's up? You seem distracted today.

>**June:** It's just... I heard Marcel from Corporate has shown up here.
>
>**Scotty:** Whaâ€”?! Marcel from MultiCo? You mean Merciless Marcel?
>
>**June:** The one and only.
>
>**Scotty:** Oh boy. Well, after everything we've been through with CNS and the reboot, I'm not really surprised.
>
>**June:** Rumor has it that he had a meeting with the sponsors this morning. Things are definitely going to change around here. Again.

>**Scotty:** Good! And let's hope they take CNS and its game mode out of the spotlight.
>
>**June:** Said like a true spokesperson for OSPUZE.
>
>**Scotty:** Hey, it's the best drink in the world.
