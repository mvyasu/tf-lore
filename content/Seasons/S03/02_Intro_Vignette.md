The video starts off by showing a neural network-like tunnel with logo for THE FINALS in the background of it.

The screen then displays a rebooting system message against a black background alongside a loading bar. It looks like so:

>**REBOOTING SYSTEM**
>**\[■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■\]**

Afterwards, the camera then travels through a tunnel of images from previous seasons and shows the logos for the sponsors of this season. The sponsors include DISSUN and ENGIMO, which are both sponsors from Japan.

The video then cuts to a shot of Kyoto, the new map for the season, and is accompanied with dialogue by Scotty.

>**Scotty:** Introducing Season 3-3-3!

>**Scotty:** Wait. June, weren't we supposed to be back in the usual arenas after the reboot?
>
>**June:** Is that a samurai over there? I mean, we expected Kyoto, but this is not the 22nd century version. Maybe it's from the AI. Shall we jump in?
>
>**Scotty:** Yep! Let's go!

A few shots of Kyoto are shown and then Scotty says the following:

>**Scotty:** Here we go contestants! Terminal Attack is back and it looks like it's here to stay!

>**June:** Plus our ranked play has changed! Contestants will now be playing Terminal Attack to rise through the leagues!

>**Scotty:** There's also a new world tour on the books! It's a series of limited time tournaments and events scheduled throughout the season!

>**June:** Not to mention some new weapons and a new specialization. That's mix things up!

The video ends on the same versus shot from the Season 3 trailer and transitions to logo for THE FINALS.
