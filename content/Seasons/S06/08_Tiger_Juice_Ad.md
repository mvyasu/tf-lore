The advertisement begins with a top-down view of an aluminum can being cracked open. It reveals a yellow glow inside of the can and then proceeds to zoom out.

It is revealed that the can is inside a person's pupil. The pupil transitions from a circular shape to an oval shape and then the camera zoom into the pupil.

A roar can be heard. The ad then continues from the point-of-view of a person driving a vehicle made of bones. They are driving through a tunnel and hit a tiger that is going across a crossing for tigers. The tiger roars and is attached to the driver.

The driver then smacks the tiger with their right fist and the tiger's head is pushed to the left.

A set of teeth chomp down over the current point-of-view and a child-like voice can be heard shouting the following:

>**Kid Voice:** Surprise!

The person from earlier is now flying through the area with their arms in front of them. Bubbles can be seen passing them as they approach what appears to be an oval pupil.

Once they reach said pupil, they enter a spiral of tentacles. Towards the end of the spiral, the camera goes back in reverse through all of the scenes until it reaches the pupil from the beginning.

The advertisement than transitions to the end which includes a can of OSPUZE Tiger Juice and a deep voice says the following:

>**Deep Voice:** Pour! Pour! Perform!

The fine print at the bottom of the advertisement says the following:

```
Ospuze Tiger Juice™ contains up to 40% extract from T1ger Fruit/TrashPaw, exclusively engineered to thrive in the nutrient-rich soils of the South Atlantic Landfill. No animals, mascots or actual tigers were compromised in harvesting. All fruit matter is landfill-grown, grade-A, and certified to trigger your inner alpha-carnivore. Pop. Pour. Perform.­™ is not merely a slogan–it is a sequence. Failure to observe proper order may result in disorientation, sensory overlap, or spontaneous multilingual roaring. Under no circumstances should "Perform" precede "Pop", unless under supervised conditions or sanctioned exhibitions. Use of Ospuze Tiger Juice™ may result in elevated heart rate, visual sharpness, and a temporary reassessment of the food chain. Reported effects include momentary disassociation from spatial norms, intense color saturation, and minor conversational latency with inanimate objects. Symptoms typically subside. Do not taunt the can. T1ger Fruit/TrashPaw™ is a registered trademark of Trentila: The Taste of Tomorrow.
