>**June:** Well, that's the third door she slammed this week.
>
>**Scotty:** She's been trying to keep HydraQ out of the show forever. And now they're the official sponsor for the upcoming season.
>
>**June:** A little rivalry is always good business. And not matter how many doors Sofia slams, Marcel's not changing his mind.
>
>**Scotty:** Yeah, but no roll out, no announcement. And production said that HydraQ material and promo assets have just vanished.

>**June:** What do you mean vanished?
>
>**Scotty:** The files, the campaign rollout, everything is gone! Ten million multibucks says it's CNS. Something brews on the horizon, remember?
>
>**June:** This again?
>
>**Scotty:** Yes, this again! We still don't have a sponsor for the next season. Tell me I'm wrong.
