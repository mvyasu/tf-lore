## THE FINALS

#### The World

THE FINALS is the greatest virtual game show on the planet, with a large, global fan base. THE FINALS is a window to a bigger world in which the game show is set, consisting of the Meatspace and the Virtual World, but most people spend their time in the Virtual World. The story takes place about 75 years in the future.

#### The Gameshow

Contestants and showrunners all join through VR-tech. 

Contestants are largely unknown before they compete; fame comes with being on and winning the game show. Sponsors want exposure to this massive audience for their brand and products/services, and sponsored gear is a sign of a success for contestants.

THE FINALS feels sporty, but it leans away from sports and toward entertainment. THE FINALS is not about survival - even though the combat and competition can be brutal, the violence is balanced by the show's approachable and playful premise and style. This relates to our style & tone pillar of “appeal and brutality.” “Coin death” and VR-effects communicate that this isn’t real; no one is getting hurt.

## Why have this site?

THE FINALS has had a lot of lore revealed throughout the years, but it has been a tiny bit hard following along with how the story has progressed. That is why this compilation of lore was put together.
